# Experience

My passion for data analysis, even within a legal context, has led me to practice law and innovative methods of law teaching, designing new software tools and tools for working with legal data. I have also pursued my passion for data science in diverse fields, including sport, the environment and bioinformatics.

## Law

My legal career has included extensive litigation and investigation work, including Supreme Court and High Court appearances. I have been a solicitor for an international law firm, a barrister, a commercial solicitor, in-house counsel, a law teacher and principal of my own legal practice.

I have presented on law, teaching methods, information and technology to law teachers.

I have experience teaching law students about commercial practice, equity and trusts. I have experimented with different feedback systems to test students’ knowledge in tests and assignments, and with graphical representation of legal concepts.

## Computing and data science

I code in several languages and continue to experiment and innovate:

As a legal data scientist, I study how to structure legal information and incorporate this into legal processes or software. In conjunction with this my legal software includes:

programs to extract information from word processed-document formats.
programs to transform simple text data (markup formats) into conventional document formats like .docx.
new graphic interfaces for visualising and manipulating legal text data.
I have written data tools to help process public environmental data including the status of clearing applications and assess clearing approval statistics.

In the sports area, I have developed a mobile scoring app (a cricket scoring program for iOS).

I have worked as a research associate in the field of bioinformatics, which requires a familiarity with biology, genetics and high performance computing.

## Policy and research

I am interested in the extent to which legal ‘solutions’ that are encoded in legislation, like environmental legislation, will ultimately succeed or fail because of the algorithms suggested by the relevant legal policy.
