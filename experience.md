# Experience

## Law

My legal career has included extensive litigation and investigation work, including Supreme Court and High Court appearances. I have been a solicitor for an international law firm, a barrister, a commercial solicitor, in-house counsel, a law teacher and principal of my own legal practice.

I have presented on law, teaching methods, information and technology to law teachers.

I have experience teaching law students about commercial practice, equity and trusts. I have experimented with different feedback systems to test studentsâ€™ knowledge in tests and assignments, and with graphical representation of legal concepts.

## Computer science

I code in several languages and continue to experiment and innovate:

## Legal data science

As a legal data scientist, I study how to structure legal information and incorporate this into legal processes or software. My own legal software that I have developed for legal data science includes:

 - programs to extract information from word processed-document formats.
 - programs to transform simple text data (markup formats) into conventional document formats like .docx.
 - new graphic interfaces for visualising and manipulating legal text data.

## Environmental law data

I have written data tools to help process public environmental data including the status of clearing applications and assess clearing approval statistics.

## Sport

I have developed a mobile scoring app (Junior Cricket Scorer, a cricket scoring program for iOS). This has been developed and tested with assistance from parents from a local sporting club.

I have also worked at the WACA in sports administration, handling competition administration and the MyCricket scoring data.

## Bioinformatics (UWA)

I have worked as a research associate in the field of bioinformatics, which requires a familiarity with biology, genetics and high performance computing. My experience includes administering High Performance Computing architecture, working with single cell genomics data pipelines, and testing COVID-19 related diagnostic tools in an HPC environment, in conjunction with Aiden Lab.
