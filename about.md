# About

I enjoy working with data and algorithms that help solve problems and improve computing, legal and business processes. I pursue my passion for data in diverse fields that include computer science, law, the environment, and bioinformatics research (i.e. the genetic information obtained through next-generation DNA sequencing).

I am qualified as a lawyer but many of my interests involve data science. I also have a computer science degree, with a minor in English. This reflects my skills and interests in both analysis and communication. I have coded for longer than I have practised law, and I have practised law for longer than many coders have been alive.

For a long time I’ve been interested in the data we use to work, even in non-scientific disciplines like law. In particular, I am interested in how we transform, analyse and communicate data to solve legal problems, or to create legal documents. This has led me to a fairly novel approach to creating data science tools for legal information. With enough concentrated attention, I’ve discovered you can be a data scientist in almost any field, even if those within that field do not recognise it.

My software applications and tools are, not surprisingly, centred on data collection and analysis. This includes tools for working with legal texts, and it also includes sports scoring apps.
