# About

I am a qualified lawyer with qualifications in computer science (B.Sc) and diverse experience in data science and software development. 

I enjoy working with data and algorithms to help solve problems in law, science, computing, sport, business and environmental areas.  As someone who enjoys working with data across many different disciplines, I can more accurately describe myself as a data scientists.  My data science work history including  bioinformatics research (i.e. the genetic information obtained through next-generation DNA sequencing) and creating software for sports scoring and environmental data analysis.

For a long time Iâ€™ve been interested in the data we use to work, even in non-scientific disciplines like law. In particular, I am interested in how we transform, analyse and communicate data to solve legal problems, or to create legal documents. This has led me to expolore the novel field of legal data science, for which it has been necessary to create my own cusrtom data science tools. 

My software applications and tools are, not surprisingly, centred on data collection and analysis. This includes tools for working with legal texts, and it also includes sports scoring apps.
